Data Exploration and Visualization Outputs:

display(df): This command shows the first few rows of the dataset, providing a glimpse of the data's structure.

display(features.head(), targets.head()): Displays the first few rows of the features and targets DataFrames, allowing you to inspect the selected columns.

Visualizations:

sns.countplot(targets['Non_Severe']): A count plot showing the distribution of the target variable ('Non_Severe'), helping you understand the balance or imbalance in the severity classes.
sns.barplot(data=temp_df, y="Indicator", x="Occurrence_Count"): Bar plot showing the occurrence count of each symptom.
plt.pie(data=temp_df, x="Occurrence_Count", labels=temp_df["Indicator"]): Pie chart representing the proportion of each symptom in the dataset.
sns.countplot(data=feats, x='Total_Symptom', hue='Severity_None'): Count plot showing the relationship between the total symptom count and severity.
Correlation Matrix Visualization:

The heatmap visualizes the correlation matrix (sns.heatmap(corrmat, ...)) showing the correlation coefficients between different features and the target variable.
Modeling Outputs:

Random Forest Classifier (RFC):

rfc.score(x_test, y_test): Outputs the accuracy score of the RandomForestClassifier on the test set.
Logistic Regression (LR):

lr.score(x_test, y_test): Outputs the accuracy score of the Logistic Regression model on the test set.
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC):

DTC.score(x_test, y_test): Outputs the accuracy score of the Decision Tree Classifier on the test set.
Hyperparameter Tuning Outputs:

For each model (RFC, LR, DTC), the code performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The tuned models are stored in rfc_tune, lr_tune, and dtc_tune.
The best hyperparameters for RandomForestClassifier are printed using print(rf_reg.best_estimator_).
The best hyperparameters for Logistic Regression are printed using print(lr_reg.best_estimator_).
The best hyperparameters for DecisionTreeClassifier are printed using print(dtc_reg.best_estimator_).
Cross-Validation Scores:

Cross-validation scores are calculated for the tuned models using cross_val_score.
The mean cross-validation score for each model is printed, providing an estimate of the model's performance across different folds.
Overall, the outputs help you understand the data distribution, relationships between features, and the performance of different machine learning models on the given dataset.
